## Installation

Just install the `rubocop-chef` gem

```bash
chef gem install rubocop-chef
```

## Usage

You need to tell RuboCop to load the Chef extension. There are three
ways to do this:

### RuboCop configuration file

Put this into your `.rubocop.yml`.

```
require: rubocop-chef
```

Now you can run `rubocop` and it will automatically load the RuboCop Chef
cops together with the standard cops.

### Command line

```bash
rubocop --require rubocop-chef
```

### Rake task

```ruby
RuboCop::RakeTask.new do |task|
  task.requires << 'rubocop-chef'
end
```

## The Cops

All cops are located under
[`lib/rubocop/cop/chef`](lib/rubocop/cop/chef), and contain
examples/documentation.

In your `.rubocop.yml`, you may treat the Chef cops just like any other
cop. For example:

```yaml
Chef/AttributeKeys:
  Exclude:
    - libraries/my_vendored_file.rb
```

## License

`rubocop-chef` is based on `rubocop-rspec`, which is MIT licensed. [See the accompanying file](MIT-LICENSE.md) for
